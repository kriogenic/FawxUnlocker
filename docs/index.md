<h3>What this tool does</h3>
This tool recalculates the CRC32 checksum that Scrap Mechanic uses in the outfit unlock file.<br>
It does this by using an already uploaded fully unlocked unlock file.<br>
It takes your steam ID and applies the CRC32 checksum to the already existing file and makes it available to download.<br>
<b>So I repeat, this downloads a fully unlocked outfit file (Vanilla + Fawx Garments) with a recalculated CRC32 so that it will load in your game</b>

<h3>What this tool doesn't do</h3>
You can not select which outfits to unlock, this will unlock them all (if some outfits are missing, tool may require update)
